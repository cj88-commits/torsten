# Record Collection

A self-hosted music player for Android, built for [Subsonic](http://www.subsonic.org/)-compatible servers (Navidrome, Airsonic, Subsonic, etc.).

---

## What it is

Record Collection is a minimal, album-first Android client for your self-hosted music library. It connects to any Subsonic-compatible server, syncs your album catalogue locally, and lets you stream or download your music — no streaming service required.

---

## Features

- **Album grid** — browse your library sorted A–Z, by decade, recently played, starred, or downloaded
- **Artist view** — collapsing hero with per-artist album grid
- **Streaming** — configurable quality per network type (WiFi / mobile); original or Opus transcoding
- **Offline playback** — download albums for playback without a connection
- **Now Playing** — full-screen player with seek bar, buffered position, and track list
- **Persistent playback** — Media3 `MediaSessionService`; resumes after restart
- **Scrobbling** — last.fm-compatible scrobbling via the Subsonic API
- **ReplayGain** — normalise loudness across tracks
- **Image caching** — configurable on-device cover art cache (250 MB – 2 GB)
- **Offline cover art** — cover art is cached with a stable key so it displays correctly in flight mode

---

## Building from source

**Prerequisites**

- Android Studio Ladybug (2024.2) or later
- JDK 17
- Android SDK with API 35 platform installed

**Steps**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cj88-commits/record-collection.git

The debug APK is written to `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

To produce a release build, create `keystore.properties` in the project root:

```properties

keyPassword=your-key-password
```

Then run:

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease

## Compatibility

| Server | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Navidrome | Tested |
| Airsonic-Advanced | Should work |
| Subsonic | Should work |
| Jellyfin (Subsonic API) | Should work |

Connections over Tailscale (including self-signed certificates on private IP ranges) are supported.

## Known limitations

- **No podcast support** — the app is music-only
- **No playlist management** — playlists cannot be created or edited from the app
- **Cover art cache changes require restart** — adjusting the image cache size limit takes effect on the next app launch
- **Transcoding depends on server** — format and bitrate options are only available if your server supports transcoding
